# online_voting_system
This project is done by me for learning purpose using PHP, CSS.
developed to increase the voting percent and help the disabled and to people who are far away from voting stations
every function in this project is written in different pages and connected using xamp application.
Those connections are overseen by the connection.php file.
login.php file is used to login to the system as voter.
register.php is used to register in the system
sql is used to store data and verify the users
dashboard.php contains the structure of the webpage
logout for logining out after the casting vote
it requires a folder in the system to contain the logo of the parties
